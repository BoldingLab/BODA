# 3D Printing and Post-Processing Instructions

## Method 1: Starting a 3D Print from Autodesk Fusion

### Required Software
- Autodesk Fusion
- PreForm software
- Form Labs printer

### Steps
1. **File Preparation**
   - Open the step file in AutoDesk Fusion
   - Select File -> 3D Print from the top left menu

2. **Component Selection**
   - Select the component(s) for printing
   - Click "OK" to launch PreForm
   - *Note: If PreForm doesn't launch, restart the computer and try again*
   - For multiple components:
     - Repeat the export process for each component
     - Alternatively, use FormLabs' copy/paste feature for identical components

3. **Orientation Setup**
   - Select "Orient" from the left menu
   - Orient components so cavities face upward
   - Use "Auto-Orient Selected" when unsure

4. **Printer Settings Configuration**
   - Review printer settings in the right panel
   - Layer Thickness recommendations:
     - Select "Adaptive" for balanced quality and print time
     - Lower values = higher quality but longer print time

5. **Support Generation**
   - Select "Support" from left menu
   - Click "Auto-Generate All"

6. **Start Print**
   - Click "Upload to Queue" (bottom right)

**Important:** Don't leave prints in printer over 24 hours (e.g., avoid starting prints on Friday for Monday retrieval)

## Method 2: Starting a 3D Print from PreForm

### Steps
1. Open STL file in PreForm
2. Verify layer thickness settings
3. Check component orientation
4. Verify support structures and rafts
5. Click "Upload to Queue"

## Post-Processing Instructions

### Cleaning Printed Components

#### Required Materials
- Isopropyl alcohol
- Wire cutter or wedge
- Forceps
- Beaker
- Wash bottle with isopropyl alcohol
- Compressed air (optional)

#### Steps
1. **Printer Access**
   - Open printer hood
   - Lift inside latch above base plate

2. **Component Removal**
   - Remove base plate
   - Separate components using wire cutter or wedge
   - *Technique:* Lay wire cutter flat on base plate, squeeze into raft edges

3. **Initial Cleaning**
   - Place separated components in isopropyl alcohol vat

4. **Base Plate Cleaning**
   - Clean base plate with isopropyl alcohol
   - Clean all sides thoroughly
   - Return to printer and secure latch
   - *Note: Listen for audible latch confirmation*

5. **Detailed Component Cleaning**
   - Remove two components at a time using forceps
   - Suspend above beaker filled with isopropyl alcohol
   - Ensure components are submerged

6. **Centrifuge Cleaning**
   - Run centrifuge for 6 minutes total
   - Rotate components 180Â° after 3 minutes

7. **Final Cleaning**
   - Flush cavities with isopropyl alcohol wash bottle
   - Allow to dry naturally or use compressed air
   - Repeat if residual resin visible
   - *Note: Unwashed resin appears as non-drying liquid*

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for remaining components

### Painting Instructions

#### Required Materials
- Black paint
- Paint brush
- Paint tray

#### Steps
1. **Paint Preparation**
   - Pour small amount of black paint into tray

2. **Application**
   - Carefully paint miniscope interior
   - Avoid optical component cavities
   - Maintain clean edges

3. **Drying**
   - Allow to dry completely before installing optics
   - **Important:** Do not use compressed air to accelerate drying

## Safety Notes
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Wear appropriate PPE when handling isopropyl alcohol
- Dispose of waste materials properly
- Clean all work surfaces after use
